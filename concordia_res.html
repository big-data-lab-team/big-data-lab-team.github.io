            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>
            If your trip has been approved by Tristan, you can count on
            airfare, accommodation (hotel), transportation to/from the
            airport, and conference registration to be reimbursed by the
            lab. However, please pay attention to the following points: 
            <ol>
                <li>Travel expenses have to comply to <a
                href="https://search.concordia.ca/texis/search/redir.html?query=travel+policy&pr=cspace&prox=page&rorder=500&rprox=500&rdfreq=500&rwfreq=500&rlead=500&rdepth=0&sufs=0&order=r&u=https%3A//cspace.concordia.ca/content/dam/cspace/services/financial/docs/Travel_and_Conference_Policy_Handbook.pdf%23search%3Dtravel%2520policy">Concordia's
                travel policy</a>. In particular, you should get receipts
                for any expense to be reimbursed. Talk to Tristan if you
                have doubts about eligible expenses.</li>
                <li>Travel expenses can only be reimbursed after you have
                returned from the trip and filled a travel expense report.
                It means that you will have to advance money upfront. You
                can reduce the amount you will have to advance by booking
                your flight and hotel through a travel agency, as described in the procedure below. </li>
                <li>Please apply to the travel awards below, and any other
                student award that the conference may offer. Our travel
                budget is limited, travel awards are an important way to
                increase travelling opportunities for you and other
                students in the lab.  
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <h3>How to book a flight and hotel through the travel agency</h3>
            <p>Booking your flight and hotel through the travel agency will prevent you from having to advance money before being reimbursed. Here is the procedure 
                to do it:
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the flight you would like to take, and the area where you would like to stay. Check the conference registration fees.</li>
                    <li>Get a first estimate of how much the trip would cost overall.</li>
                    <li>Ask Tristan for pre-approval and for the account number to use.</li>
                    <li>Contact one of Concordia's preferred travel agents (see info <a href="https://cspace.concordia.ca/services/budget-expenses-finance/corporate-card/travel-faq.html">here</a>),
                    with your flight and/or hotel booking request.</li>
                    <li>The travel agent will email your reservation to Katherine Scribner. Forward this email to Tristan, asking for email approval.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fill in the <a href="https://cspace.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/services/financial/docs/travel-voucher-form.pdf">travel voucher form</a>. You will need
                        the account number mentioned previously. Print, sign, send to Tristan for signature, forward to K. Scribner when signed.</li>
                    <li>Your flight and/or hotel should now be booked, congratulations :)</li>
                </ol>
