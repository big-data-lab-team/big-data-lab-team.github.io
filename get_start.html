            <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
            <p>Code is first-class citizen in the lab. It is the primary output of your research.</p>
            <p>Any code in the lab is by default:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a Git repository.</li>
                <li>On GitHub.</li>
                <li>Hosted under the <a href="https://github.com/big-data-lab-team">/bin</a> organization.</li>
                <li>Licensed under GPL-3.0 (<a href="https://www.gnu.org">Free Software</a> is good) or MIT (for a library).</li>
                <li>Written in Python.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> To contribute to a code base (including your own project):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fork the repository on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Push commits to your fork.</li>
                <li> Make Pull Requests (PRs) to the base repository.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before releasing a repository, make it usable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a demo (data + expected answer) to demonstrate the main functionality.</li>
                <li>Write a README.md file.</li>
                <li>Make a 1-line installation procedure using pip, gem, cmake or autotools.</li>
                <li>Document all the user-facing functions.</li>
                <li>Write tests using pytest.</li>
                <li>Configure continuous integration in the repository.</li>
                <li>Push a container image to DockerHub (only if relevant).</li>
                <li>Add badges to README.md (if relevant).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once a release is ready:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tag it in the Git repository.</li>
                <li>Write release notes on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Create a develop branch. After the first release, the master branch will always contain the latest release; develop will contain non-released commits.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>See examples in <a href="https://github.com/big-data-lab-team">/bin</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Adopt a writing schedule as soon as possible and comply to it. Suggestion to start: 4 hours per week.</li>
                <li>Suggestions on what to write:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write your own summary any time you read a paper.</li>
                    <li>Write a few paragraphs on your current work or ideas.</li>
                    <li>Outline your next paper or thesis.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Create detailed outlines of important documents (papers, theses) as early as possible.</li>
                <li>Tools</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Latex by default. Use Google Docs when heavy collaboration is expected (e.g., brainstorming document). <a href="https://github.com/big-data-lab-team/concordia-master-thesis-template">Here</a> is a Latex template for a Concordia Master's thesis.</li>
                    <li>Create a Git repository for papers and theses, containing:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Latex/Bibtex source.</li>
                        <li> Any script (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a>) and data required to reproduce Figures. You might loose a few hours cleaning up your scripts but it will save you days when you need to update your manuscript.</li>
                        <li>See example <a href="https://github.com/big-data-lab-team/paper-sequential-split-merge">here</a>.</li>
                        <li> Push the Git repository on GitHub and encourage collaborators to fork/PRs (see Code section).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Useful books and references about writing:</li>

            </ul>

          <h2 id="preprint">Pre-prints</h2> <p>All papers under review 
          must be submitted as pre-prints to arXiv or bioRxiv, unless 
          otherwise mentioned. A pre-print is a version of a paper that 
          is posted to a repository and can be accessible to readers 
          before its publication in a peer-reviewed journal or 
          conference. There are well-known pre-print databases such as 
          arXiv.org (for Computer Science, Engineering and many 
			other scientific fields), and bioRxiv (for Biology 
			researches). Pre-prints are important because they are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Free for both readers and authors.</li> 
				<li>Accessible to everyone while it is on the process 
				of reviewing by a journal which mostly takes several months.</li> 
				<li>Immediately citable. </li> 
				<li>Safely archived and gets a date stamped.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get familiar with the procedure of submitting a 
			paper to arXiv you might find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i4C8yxbs48">this YouTube video</a> useful. 
			Please note that submitting paper as a PDFLaTeX wrapper, 
			using pdfpages, is not acceptable and it will end up to 
			<q>Incomplete</q> status after a long period of waiting for 
			getting the permanent identifier code. Instead,
            create an archive containing your TeX source file with all the necessary 
			files for generating the PDF format of your paper, and upload
			this archive to arXiv.</p>
                
            <blockquote>
            <p> e.g.: <i>Paper.tex</i> is the Latex source file of your paper:
            <ul>
				<li>All appropriate figures used in the paper (.pdf, .png and .jpg, etc)</li>
				<li>All files related to bibliography (.bbl , .bib, e.g. :  paper.bbl, papper.bib)</li>
				<li>If you use IEEE journal templates make sure that your zip file contains IEEEabrv.bib, IEEEtran.bst and IEEEtran.cls</li>
			</ul> </p> </blockquote> <p> After receiving the permanent 
			arXiv identifier (e.g.: 1809.10139) by email, Please update 
			the lab website (Pre-prints/submitted papers section under 
			the publications tab) with the arXiv number. </p> <img

            <h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>
            <p>Most of your papers will be based on experiments conducted with your developed software. Be meticulous and patient, it takes time to get a good experimental setup. Make yours this quote by David Donoho et al (2009):</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            the scientific method's central motivation is the ubiquity of error - <br><br>
            
            the awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywehere <br><br>
            
            and that the scientits' effort is primarily expended in recognizing and rooting out error. <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p> In other words, think of all possible causes that might corrupt your results: background tasks running on computers, software bugs, data corruption, etc</p>

            <p>The lab is committed to the following values:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>High quality is preferable to high quantity.</li>
                <li>Technical quality is a requirement to scientific quality.</li>
                <li>Openness leads to better content.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> The target lab culture is to promote frequent informal interactions, personal freedom, academic integrity, gender equality, cultural diversity and ... having fun doing research!</p>
            
        
            <h2 id="communication-and-interactions">Communication and interactions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Never hesitate to ask a question to anyone.</li>
                <li>Register to <a href="https://big-data-lab-team.slack.com/">Slack</a> (in the future me might use <a href="https://about.mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a> instead).</li>
                <li>Share information with others in the lab. It includes ideas, code snippets, technical tips, etc Your co-workers are not your competitors, you are on the same side.</li>
                <li>Communicate regularly with Tristan. On Slack, by email or by requesting a meeting whenever required. Don't let any issue block your work or bother you for too long without talking about it.</li>
                <li> Attend hackathons, in particular those organized by <a href="http://brainhack.org/">BrainHack</a> in Montreal. Use hackathons to demonstrate your project, collect feedback on it, and stay up-to-date on technology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="code-of-conduct"> Code of conduct</h2>
            <p>This section is largely copied from <a href="https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Whitaker's lab Code of Conduct.</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form will not be tolerated. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
                <li>Work hours: The hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails, pull requests or Slack messages over the weekend or late at night, but no lab members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours. Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. Ideally, all lab members will have at least a few hours each week to overlap with Tristan in order to stay in touch, but it is the policy of the lab that every member is already self-motivated and doesn't need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet their goals.</li>
                <li>If you experience any challenges of any kind related those topics, please contact Tristan. All communication will be treated as confidential.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharing data, code and text through Git repositories hosted on GitHub is a good way to protect us against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct">scientific misconduct</a>.</li>
                <li>Reusing text or code from others' work is fine (even encouraged) as long as the source is properly credited. Omitting to cite the source is plagiarism.</li>
                <li>Data fabrication or falsification is evil. Don't even think about it. If your data looks strange, don't delete or omit it. Repeat the experiment and try to understand what is going on, you will learn more. If your graph is missing a point or two and the submission deadline is coming too soon, let the graph be incomplete. You will feel better and it will improve the paper. There is no such thing as a good or a bad result, there are just results.</li>
